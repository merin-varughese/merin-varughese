Dear Hiring Team,

I am writing to express my strong interest in a Quality Assurance Analyst role within your organization, and I invite you to review my dedicated QA portfolio hosted here on GitHub. As a dedicated Quality Assurance professional with **over five years of hands-on experience**, I am confident that my expertise in the full software testing lifecycle, meticulous approach to quality, and strong collaborative skills make me an exceptional candidate.

Throughout my career, I have excelled in environments that demand thorough testing and commitment to product excellence. I am highly proficient in managing the testing process, from developing comprehensive test plans and test cases to executing **functional, regression, and UAT** to ensure robust software delivery across various applications, including financial services and enterprise-level CRM systems.

### Key Skills and Experience:

* **Test Strategy & Execution:** My experience includes **detailed manual testing** combined with utilizing **automated test suites** for maintenance and execution, which successfully achieved a quantifiable **30% reduction in regression time**.
* **Technical Validation:** I possess proficiency in **API testing** for back-end service validation and using basic **SQL** to perform critical data integrity checks for high-stakes projects.
* **Defect Management:** I am an expert in defect lifecycle management, consistently using **JIRA** to log, track, and prioritize issues, contributing to a significant reduction in defect resolution time.
* **Collaboration:** I excel at cross-functional communication and collaboration, working closely with development teams, product owners, and business analysts in Agile Scrum environments.

### Addressing the Career Gap:

You may note a gap in my professional timeline. This was due to a personal move to complete my green card process, which limited my ability to work full-time. However, I am a firm believer in continuous professional development. During this time, I actively sought out **freelance software testing opportunities on TestIO**, where I performed functional and cross-platform compatibility testing. This proactive engagement ensured my technical skills remained sharp and current with various testing methodologies.

I am eager to re-engage my career fully and apply my reliable work ethic and analytical mindset to contribute to your team's success. Thank you for your time and consideration.

Sincerely,
Merin Varughese
